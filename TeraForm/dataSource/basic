# Terraform Configuration Explanation

## Data Sources (data blocks)
These are used to reference existing resources in your Azure subscription. By using data sources, you can dynamically fetch details about the resources, such as Virtual Networks (VNets), Subnets, and Network Security Groups (NSGs), without hard-coding all the information.

## Network Interface (`azurerm_network_interface`)
This resource connects the Virtual Machine (VM) to the subnet and NSG. The `azurerm_network_interface` resource creates a network interface in your specified subnet, enabling the VM to communicate within the network.

## Virtual Machine (`azurerm_virtual_machine`)
This resource is used to create the actual VM. You specify details such as the VM size, image, and storage settings. The VM is then connected to the network using the Network Interface that you created earlier.

## Network Interface Security Group Association (`azurerm_network_interface_security_group_association`)
This resource is used to link the NIC (Network Interface) with the NSG (Network Security Group). In newer versions of Terraformâ€™s Azure provider, the association of a NIC with an NSG is done through this separate resource. This decoupling allows for more flexibility and modularity in managing network configurations.

### NIC and NSG Decoupling
The Network Interface is defined first, and then the NSG is associated with it through a separate resource. This method of managing resources ensures that configurations are more maintainable and aligned with best practices in Terraform.
